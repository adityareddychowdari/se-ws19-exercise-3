    /**
     * This method evaluates an intersection point between an infinite plane and a ray.
     * Within the same coordinate space, the plane is described using the algebraic form
     * and the ray originates from the coordinate point [0, 0, 0], i.e., the origin.
     * If multiple intersection points exist, the intersection point closest to the
     * origin is returned. If no intersection exists, a null is returned.
     *
     * Implementation is based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93plane_intersection.
     * Since the ray always starts in the origin, we can use ray for both l and l_0 (we use the same
     * Vec3D datatype for points and vectors).
     * @param ray Line that starts at the camera position.
     * @return Intersection point of line and plane. If multiple intersection points exist, the the
     * closest to the camera position is returned. If no intersection exists, return null.
